"""
This script fetches the task data of a given employee from the public 
API (jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) and displays the progress of completed tasks.

It takes an employee ID as a command-line argument and prints the following:

1. The employee's name.
2. The number of completed tasks vs the total number of tasks.
3. The titles of completed tasks.

The script uses the requests module to fetch the data from the API and handles 
error cases gracefully.

Usage:
    $ python3 0-gather_data_from_an_API.py <employee_id>
